I am about to start my life as an IT Professional, so I thought why not to share my whole experience of what I learnt and what I went through my whole undergraduate in Computer Science.

I started my Bachelors in 2016 and was literally scared as I had no prior experience of computer science. Even, the situation was that bad that if someone asked me about the languages I know, I was like Hindi, English...So, that's how I started my first year.
After that, I got to know some basics of programming, how to code actually. I learnt Python as my first ever programming language and coded many programs starting with the very basic, A Calculator followed by patterns. I was astonished to see great programmers in my batch. Many of them were like who finished the whole program in the time I understood the question. That was challenging for me. I got frustrated many times throughout the course as I wasn't able to code the program, I wasn't able to find the right approach.
Somehow, I passed the semester with a decent GPA, as I scored better in other subjects. Entering the second semester, I was introduced to the master of Computer Science, DATA STRUCTURES & ALGORITHMS. Throughout the course, everyone told me, "Dude, this is the course. This will get you a job. Get a mastery in this" and in my head, I was like, "Just let me get better with coding first". I was frustrated. I wasn't able to code, couldn't understand Algorithms. I was actually depressed. I was doubting my decision of taking Computer Science. Then after all this mess, a time come in everyone's life in which a man thinks "JUST, LET IT BE". I kinda liked that, and switched my focus from Algorithms to CS:GO. I attended classes for attendance, completed my assignments from borrowing the code from someone, and in the whole free time I was either watching some sort of series/movies or playing games.
Still, passed my second semester with a decent GPA (got those engineering skills).
I did this a long time, spent my summer vacations doing nothing at home, just lying, hanging out with my frineds and sleeping tight. Then, I came back to college, again TV Series, movies, games and studying just before exams. That was my schedule. I started thinking very low of me.
Again, ended my second year with a decent GPA. Everyone was building their resumes at that time for internships. There is a section in the Resume which is called 'SKILLS', my frineds were having 10-20 skills in it. And for me that section consisted of 
```javascript
1. Basics of C++
2. Some HTML
3. CSS
4. Maybe Javascript
```
And that was it. I decided that I have to learn, I want to code and I will acquire the skills.
And, spent my summers lying, travelling and enjoying with friends.
Now, it was my third year. My seniors were getting placed. I heard about the companies, that were coming to the college for placements. I thought that if things go like this, I am not getting placed in any of them. I had a chat with my friend/roommate. He motivated me to learn something, mainly to atleast get started with something.
So, after a lot of thinking, I decided to learn Node.js to be able to handle the whole backend, the database calls. These things actually attracted me for a long time, like how things work at the back as we only get to see the beautiful side.
I started my Javascript course, learnt the syntax, coded some basic programs in it and after having sufficient knowledge of it, I started learning Node.js. Along with that, I started making some small projects from what I have learnt. 
And as a result of all this, after about 2-3 months, I was able to build the backend of many real time projects. I started having fun in it. That was the actual learning semester/phase of my whole undergrad. I acquired many skills, got to know about open source, started contributing and what not. I was enjoying the phase. In the second semester of my third year, I made a lot of projects. That was my schedule at that time, attending classes, coming back to dorm, switching on the laptop, and start coding. Now, it was the time to build my resume again and apply for some internships to get an industry level experience. Let's look at my "SKILLS" section at the end of my third year:
```javascript
1. Node.js
2. Javascript
3. Java
4. NoSQL
5. SQL
6. UI Designing
7. Docker
8. SQL
```
That summer, I grabbed an internship, worked as a Backend Developer and had a great experience in it.
Now, came my final year, I started sitting for placements, faced a few rejections and then got placed within a month in Shell IT with a Super Dream offer as a Software Development Engineer.
I never imagined in my second year that I'll get a job or I'll learn some skills. I never thought of developing a application right from the scratch. 
As everyone, I also think that what if I started all these in my first or second year. Maybe, I would be in a better place but what I have now is lifetime lessons, motivation, my skills and a search for a greater perhaps.
So, to all of those seeking for a better perhaps, starting their college life or in a situation like I was. "Don't Stop Trying". Just get started with things and trust me one day you will be a person that you've never dreamt of for yourself.

P.S: Study Data Structures with all your heart.
